# wam_filter - Release 2005 
#  version 250@(#) wam_filter 250.2@(#) 7/29/05 10:13:25 /* GCC-Clean */
########################################################################
# Edited - 2010-12-15 tk
#  Changed Category Names for Images, Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets
#  to X to stop all 100-level index logging
########################################################################
#
# -- File Format -- 
#
# Each filter line consists of five pipe delimited elements:
# Index Number|Category Name|WAM token(s)|Apply-to|Regular Expression
#
# Index Number: 
# Each filter category must have a unique number. You may repeat the
# index number if you have several filters you want to combine into a
# single category. Please ensure that any new filter category you
# create has a unique number. The filters do not need not to appear
# in number order.
#
# Category Name: 
# Custom name which will be used to classify each request in the report.
# If you set the category name to "X" (without quotes), WAM will stop
# logging statistics for requests matching that filter.
#
# WAM token(s): 
# Comma-delimited list of tokens from forward table. The filter will be
# applied to those resources matching the list of tokens.
# An asterisk (*) applies the filter to all resources.
#
# Apply-to:  
# Valid values for this are "url" and "head" (without quotes).
# head: matches against the HTTP header
# url:  matches against the GET request (portion of URL after host:port) 
#
# RegEx 
# The Regular Expression to apply to the request.  Note that standard 
# POSIX regular expressions are supported. Recall that you must escape 
# characters that are part of regex syntax e.g, period (.) or slash (/).
#
# -- Example Filter Lines --
# 
# Example "head" filter:
#
# 399|HTML|*|head|Content-[Tt]ype:[ ]*text\/html
# 
# The elements in this example filter are:
# 1. Index Number: 399. Unique identifier for this filter.
# 2. Category: HTML. If a request matches this filter, it will be
#    placed in the "HTML" category.
# 3. WAM token: *. Filter is used for every resource. 
# 4. Apply-to: head. Filter will be matched against the HTTP response header.
# 5. Regular expression: Content-[Tt]ype:[ ]*text\/html 
#
# WAM examines the HTTP headers of each response from the server and 
# categorizes any matching request as "HTML". Here is an example 
# response that would match against our filter:
#
# HTTP/1.0 200 OK
# Date: Tue, 26 Apr 2005 20:17:34 GMT
# Age: 488898
# Server: Apache/2.0.46 (Red Hat)
# Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
# Connection: close
# 
# Example "url" filter:
#
# 300|Full Text View|nature|url|.*\/full\/.*html$
#
# The elements in this example filter are:
# 1. Index Number: 300.
# 2. Category: Full Text View. If a request matches this filter, 
#    it will be placed in the "Full Text View" category.
# 3. WAM token: nature.  This filter will only be used for the resource 
#    associated with the nature WAM token.
# 4. Apply-to: url. Filter will be matched against the url of the 
#    GET request to the server.
# 5. Regular expression: .*\/full\/.*html$. Matches against any GET 
#    request whose URL contains the string "/full/" and ends with ".html"
#
# WAM examines each GET request from the client (browser) and associates 
# any matching request with the "Full Text View" category. Note this 
# happens only for those resources represented by the "nature" token
# and only if the request has not already matched a prior filter. Here is 
# an example GET request that would match against the filter. (Note that
# the "GET" and the "HTTP/1.1" are not included in the target pattern.)
#
# GET /news/2005/050418/full/050418-5.html HTTP/1.1
# 
# -- Application of Filters --
#
# 1. Filters are applied in the order in which they appear in the file,
#    not by the filter number
# 2. Each request is categorized by the first matching filter.
# 3. Any request that does not match a filter is categorized as "Other".
#   
# You should order any competing filters from specific to general. 
# For example, if you have a filter that places requests for
# Content-Type "text/html" into an "HTML" category, then it should 
# appear *after* any URL based filter that you have set up. Also, it is
# efficient to put filters for common requests at the start of the file.
# 
# Innovative has provided the default set of filters and included 
# brief comments above filters whose rationale may not be readily apparent.
# One comment that applies to several filters in the file is included here:
#
# When a server returns a "304 not modified" response, no "Content-Type" 
# is included.  Therefore, the request won't match against a "Content-Type"
# filter and will end up categorized as "Other". The default file includes
# a filter to categorize the 304 response.  In addition, however, we have
# added additional "url" filters for common requests such as javascript,
# css, html, image files, etc., in order to properly classify requests so
# that you can count them correctly or avoid logging them if you choose. 
# In the file below, we have included these URL filters after the standard 
# filters based on Content-Type.) 
# 
# -- File Organization --
#
# In the default file, we have assigned line numbers in the following groups 
# to make organizing the filters a bit easier:
# 
# 100s -- filters we suggest assigning to category "X" to stop logging requests.
# 200s -- filters based on HTTP response headers. 
# 300s -- filters to categorize HTML pages accesses.
# 400s -- filters to categorize document downloads.
# 500s -- filters to broadly categorize based on MIME type included in 
#         HTTP response. These are set up to avoid categorization 
#         as "Other" and should appear at the end of the file.

# FILTERS 
#######################################################################
# Filters in this first section categorize the most common requests. 
# Since Images, CSS, and Javascript often can account for 80% of 
# statistics, it is best to not log them. To stop logging statistics
# for a given filter, simply change its category name to "X" 
# See the commented out example for the first Images filter.
#######################################################################
# Images:
# 100|Images|*|head|Content-[Tt]ype:[ ]*image\/.*
# Example filter that stops logging requests that match this filter.
# 100|X|*|head|Content-[Tt]ype:[ ]*image\/.*
# url filters to catch "304 not modified" responses for common image files.
# 100|Images|*|url|.*\.(gif|GIF|jpg|JPG|jpeg|JPEG|png|PNG)
# Example filter that stops logging requests that match the filter
# 100|X|*|url|.*\.(gif|GIF|jpg|JPG|jpeg|JPEG|png|PNG)
# Example filter to catch dynamically generated gifs at ovid
# 100|Images|ovid|head|Content-[Tt]ype:[ ]*application\/octet-stream

# Categorize common HTTP status codes.
# Don't want to count as "hits" but still would like to log.
#######################################################################
#
# Filter "No Content" responses to avoid false hits as "text/plain" 
# For example, marking a record in ProQuest results in a 204 response.
# 200|No Content (204)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 204
# A single successful request for a PDF file can result in one 200 OK 
# response and several 206 responses -- all with Content-Type of pdf.
# This filter can be used to avoid double counting. 
# 201|Partial content (206)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 206
#
# For many resources, accessing a single html page can trigger 
# several redirects before the final HTML file is loaded with 200 OK
# response. This filter catches the redirects to avoid double counting.
#
200|No Content (204)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 204
201|Partial content (206)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 206
202|Redirect (302)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 302
203|Page moved (309)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 309
204|Bad Request (400)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 400
205|Forbidden (403)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 403
206|Page not found (404)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 404
207|Bad gateway (502)|*|head|HTTP/[0-9]\.[0-9] 502
