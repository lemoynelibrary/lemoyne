I am also the Systems Librarian for the library. Due to the COVID-19 emergency, I will be working remotely until further notice. Options to meet with me include Zoom, Google Hangouts, or phone -- you can determine which option is best for you when you make an appointment with me. See my <a href="http://resources.library.lemoyne.edu/profiles/tomkeays" target="_parent">profile page</a> for more information.</p>
